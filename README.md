# Uzbekistan freight matching prototype

A graduate thesis prototype at Suncheon National University exploring how
matching return-trip trucks with cargo could reduce empty road freight trips
in Uzbekistan. The first planned corridor is Tashkent ↔ Samarkand.

Drivers will post return trips, and shippers will post loads. A match becomes
final only after both sides confirm. Payments are outside the project scope.

## Current status

This project currently contains documentation and basic file conventions.
There is no runnable application, matching implementation, or simulation yet.
No experiments have been run, and no performance results are claimed.

## Research questions

- How much can batch matching reduce empty runs compared with
  first-come-first-served and greedy nearest matching?
- How does the benefit change at adoption levels of 10%, 30%, and 60%?
- How do detour limits, time-window slack, and load chaining affect results?

These adoption levels are planned experiment settings, not measured adoption.

## Planned architecture

- NestJS and code-first GraphQL API, with subscriptions for match alerts.
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for relational data and geospatial queries.
- Redis and BullMQ for scheduled matching jobs.
- OSRM with OpenStreetMap for road distances and travel times.
- React and TypeScript web client for shippers and administrators.
- Telegram bot for drivers.
- A simulator that uses the same matching logic as the live worker.

The matcher will be a pure TypeScript package with no database or network I/O.
Feasibility checks, configurable costs, baselines, and batch assignment will
each receive unit tests before integration.

Folders will be added only when their implementation step needs them.

## Development

Tooling and setup commands will be added in subsequent steps. Build, lint,
format-check, and test commands are not configured yet.

Keep secrets in ignored `.env` files. Only `.env.example` files containing
safe example values belong in version control.

Store database timestamps in UTC. The UI will display Asia/Tashkent time.
